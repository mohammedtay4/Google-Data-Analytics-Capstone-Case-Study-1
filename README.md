Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study
Welcome to Google Data Analytics Capstone Case Study 1 repository! This is my first hands-on, full project that I had to complete 
as a part of my Google Data Analytics Certification program. I was asked to imagine that I was working for Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused 
products for women, and meet different characters and team members. In order to answer the key business questions, you will follow the steps of the
data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

I was asked to focus on one of Bellabeatâ€™s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The
insights I discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.

As a disclaimer, this was my first ever data analytics project. It isn't perfect, but I successfully managed to perform all important processes such as:
1. Collecting data
2. Cleaning data
3. Transforming Data
4. Visualizing data
